The file lab6_Delaunay.py handles the algorithmic solutionf for all 6 of the exercices in the lab. The code is simply ran and asks for input the exercise you want to solve.
Depending on the exercise the result will be a plot shown on the screen, or the result will be written in the terminal.

The files main.cpp, voronoi.h are represent an implementaion of the Fortune's algorithm for computing voronoi diagrams. The result of this program is a list of edges, that I use 
in the fortune's.py script in order to generate a plot a visualzie the diagram obtained. 

Example usage of the algorithms is included in videos that are linked in the pdf associated with this homework.
